# Weather App #
This is a simple Weather App built with Node.js. Enter a city name and submit the form to find the weather.

## To Run ##
Use ```npm install``` to install all dependencies. ```npm start``` will start the server. Visit ```localhost:3000``` in your browser to use the app.
### Note ###
All API keys in this project are hidden as environment variables. Therefore,to run you will need to get your own API key from Open Weather Map (see Resources). Afterwards, create a file in the root directory called .env. Write your key there like this: ```KEY = "******************"```

## Resources ##
[Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) was the API used to gather the weather. The [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request#forms) module was used to easily make HTTP requests.
